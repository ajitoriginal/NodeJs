What is Node.js
    An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
    Open-source : source code is publicly available for sharing and modification
    Cross-platform : Available on Mac, Windows and Linux
    JavaScript runtime environment : ?

ECMAScript Summary
    ECMA-262 is the language specification
    ECMAScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
    JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds on top of that

Chrome's V8 Engine Summary
    A JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code
    Created by Google in 2008
    It is written in C++
    Can be used independently or embedded into other C++ programs
    Allows to write own C++ programs which can do everything that V8 can do
    C++ program can run ECMAScript and additional features that you choose to incorporate
    For example, features that are available in C++ but not available with JavaScript

JavaScript Runtime
    An environment which provides all necessary components in order to use and run a JavaScript program
    Every browser has a JavaScript engine
    A JavaScript engine is one component in the JavaScript Runtime
    Chrome Browser JavaScript Runtime
        1. JavaScript Code --> V8 JavaScript Engine [Memory <-> Call Stack] 
        2. V8 JavaScript Engine [Memory <-> Call Stack] --> Web/Browser API's [DOM, Storage, Timers]
        3. Web/Browser API's [DOM, Storage, Timers] --> Queues [Micro Task Queue, Callback Task Queue]
        4. ueues [Micro Task Queue, Callback Task Queue] --> Event Loop
        5. Event Loop --> V8 JavaScript Engine [Memory <-> Call Stack] (Repeat step 2)
                                    
What can be build with Node.js
    Traditional websites
    Backend services like APIs
    Real-time applications
    Streaming services
    CLI tools
    Multiplayer games

Node.js Summary
    It is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment
    Not a language, not a framework
    Capable of executing JavaScript code outside a browser
    Can execute standard ECMAScript language, new features through C++ bindings using the V8 engine
    Consists of C++ files which form the core features and JavaScript files which expose common utilities and some of the C++ features for easier consumption
    Node JS = [JS Library, C/C++ features, Dependencies(V8, libuv, zlib, crypto, etc)]

Modules
    It is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has its own context
    In Node.js, each file is treated as a seperate module
    Types of Modules
        Local modules - We create in our application
        Build-in modules - Node.js ships with out of the box
        Third party modules - written by other developers that we can use in our application

Local Modules Summary
    In Node.js, each file is a module that is isolated by default
    To load a module into another file, we use the require function

Module Scope
    Each loaded module in Node.js is wrapped with an IIFE that provides private scoping of code
    IIFE allows you to repeat variable or function names without any conflicts

Module Wrapper
    Node.js wrap module with a function which contains (exports, require, module, __dirname, __filename) in parameter before module code gets executed
