/*
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
OPEN SOURCE - source code is publicly available for sharing and modification.
CROSS PLATFORM - available on Mac, Windows and Linux.
JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT -provides all the necessary components in order to use and a JavaScript program outside the browser.

JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds on top of that.
A JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code.
In 2008, Google created its own JavaScript engine called V8.
V8 is written in C++ and can be used independently or can embedded into other C++ programs.
That allows you to write your own C++ programs which can do everything that V8 can do and more.
Then your C++ program can run ECMAScript and additional features that you choose to incorporate.
For example, feature that are available in C++ but not available with JavaScript.

JavaScript runtime environment is a combination of V8 engine, Web Browers API's, Queues and Event Loop.

Node.js consists C++ files which form the core features and JavaScript files which expose common utilities
and some of the C++ features(File Handeling, Input Output and Network Operations) for easier consumption.

Node REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop.

In Node.js, each file is a module that is isolated by default.
To load a module into another file, we use the require function.
When index.js is executed, the code in the module is also executed.
if the required file to import is a JavaScript file, we can skip specifying the extension
